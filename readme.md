# Chromium Bug Repro

This repo (based on the stencil component starter) includes the bare minimum required to trigger the crash in browsers using the Chromium rendering engine.

To observe:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Go to localhost:3333/components/index.html in a chromium browser. You may need to open the dev tools and resize the screen, or it may crash on its own.
